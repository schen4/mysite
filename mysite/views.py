                 When you are old and grey and full of sleep,<br/>
                 And nodding by the fire, take down this book,<br/>
                 And slowly read, and dream of the soft look<br/>
                 Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;<br/>
                 How many loved your moments of glad grace,<br/>
                 And loved your beauty with love false or true,<br/>
                 But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,<br/>
                 And loved the sorrows of your changing face;<br/>
                 And bending down beside the glowing bars,<br/>
                 Murmur, a little sadly, how love fled<br/>
                 And paced upon the mountains overhead<br/>
                 And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.<br/>
